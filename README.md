EuNeurone
=========

This software takes equation files (*.eq), and generates bytecode for numerical integration. It supports several fixed step size integrators, and variable step size. There is no limit to the number of equations or length of integration beyond memory limits. The data can be exported in simple csv files, or to HDF and also HDF5, which is compatable with Matlab.

Dependencies
------------

The software has been written to run under Linux. It requires Qt3 for the GUI, it also uses Qwt4.2 for the charts. These are version dependent, unfortunately. An updated version is under development and will become available as well. Other dependencies are GSL (GNU Scientific Library), HDF4 and HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format Version 4 and 5), where 5 is prefered due its ability to store more than 2^32  data samples. These libraries are not version dependent and should work with the versions available for your distribution. The Makefile is manually written, and not autogenerated, and paths may need to be amended. Otherwise, the code has been leak checked throughout, and is stable.
