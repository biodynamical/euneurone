=========

This software takes equation files (*.eq), and generates bytecode for numerical integration. It supports several fixed step size integrators, and variable step size. There is no limit to the number of equations or length of integration beyond memory limits. The data can be exported in simple csv files, or to HDF and also HDF5, which is compatable with Matlab.
